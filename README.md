# Stratego_Networked

Stratego_Networked is a personal project created as an extension of Stratego to be played on two computers. 
The program is meant to be packaged in two jar files, one for the server or player 1 and the other other one for the client player 2.

How to Play:

-Server needs to be executed first and the player can start setting up his starting setup while waiting for client to connect.

-Client is then excuted by the second player and can start setting up his starting setup.

-The mouse is used to choose and select squares.

-Enter key is used to confirm a player's starting setup.

-Players can choose from 10 starting setups by pressing 0-9 during the setup phase.

-Players take turns to make their moves until a flag has been captured which causes the game to end.

-When an attack is made, the two pieces are made visible to both players for 3 seconds unless a variation has been chosen

-The server player has access to a restart button, as well as variations for different game styles.
